# needdis.nvim

After some tryouts within various TODO apps I decided it would be VERY GOOD IDEA to write a lua plugin on my own.

**Note**

This is very opinionated, it is designed to match what I need. PRs appreciated though

This is because I do not want to switch programs to keep order of my tasks.

## Installation

Lazy:
```lua
return { "ochcaroline/needdis.nvim" }
```
